# bio.toast - Bio for Developers
Pre-made your bio, you design it.

## How to use
1. Browse to [bio.toast.name/your-github-username](https://bio.toast.name/_/self)
2. There! That's your bio right there. It uses [Tiny.css](https://ihsan6133.github.io/tinycss/) by default.
3. To design your own bio, read [this](https://github.com/lightly-toasted/lightly-toasted.bio.toast/blob/main/README.md).
4. Not sure what should you use, but don't like the default design? You can [find](https://github.com/search?q=%22bio.toast%22&type=repositories) other designs that you can use or copy-paste [official designs](https://gist.github.com/lightly-toasted/5935b3c0b2ea337fe579133d0fd5b4db) *(which is made by [me](https://github.com/lightly-toasted)!)*

## Missing elements
If you want to add something to your bio, open [an issue](https://github.com/lightly-toasted/bio.toast/issues/new) or [a PR](https://github.com/lightly-toasted/bio.toast/compare)(for [src/routes/\[name\]](src/routes/[name]) with proper element id).
